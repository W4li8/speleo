EPFL MT BA1 Programming in C++ (2019) - Project Speleo

The goal is to determine whether a cave can be traversed safely. 
Different modes are proposed: 
  A) The user enters the map and exit paths are shown. 
  B) The user gives a probability that some area of the map is accessible 
     and the program outputs the probability that the cave can be crossed. 
  C) The program runs in mode B) for every 1% probability increments.

The results are surprising, there seems to be a well defined threshold 
in the accessibility probability from which it is safe to attempt a 
cave traverse.
